Prover9-Mace4
=============

This is a slightly updated version of the original Prover9-Mace4 python 
application written by William McCune. Unfortunately the GUI toolkit is old 
and requires python 2.7, so this package will not run on newer python versions. 
You need to install the `python-wxgtk3.0` package (on ubuntu using the 
`sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0` command), then simply run the 
`prover9-mace4.py` file from this directory.
